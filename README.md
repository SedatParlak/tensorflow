## Introduction to TensorFlow

This section covers the basics of TensorFlow, including creating and manipulating tensors, using GPUs, and optimizing code with `tf.function`.

## Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow

This section covers how to build and train regression models using TensorFlow, including preparing data, defining loss functions and optimization functions, and diagnosing problems.

## Neural Network Classification with TensorFlow

This section covers how to build and train classification models using TensorFlow, including working with binary and multi-class data, plotting performance metrics, and matching input and output shapes.

## Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow

This section covers how to build convolutional neural networks with TensorFlow for computer vision problems, including diagnosing problems, using real-world images, and working with `Conv2D` and pooling layers.

## Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 1: Feature Extraction

This section covers how to use pre-trained models and TensorFlow Hub for feature extraction, and how to use TensorBoard to compare model performance.

## Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 2: Fine-tuning

This section covers how to set up and run machine learning experiments, use data augmentation, fine-tune pre-trained models, and use callbacks during training.

## Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 3: Scaling Up (Food Vision mini)

This section covers how to scale up existing models, evaluate models, and beat the original Food101 paper using only 10% of the data.

## Milestone Project 1: Food Vision

This project combines everything learned in the previous sections to build a computer vision model capable of classifying 101 different kinds of food.

## NLP Fundamentals in TensorFlow

This section covers how to preprocess natural language text, create word embeddings, and build neural networks capable of binary and multi-class classification using RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and CNNs.

## Milestone Project 2: SkimLit

This project replicates the model used in the PubMed 200k paper to classify different sequences in medical abstracts

## Time series fundamentals

Diagnosing time series problems, preparing data for time series neural networks, understanding and using different evaluation methods, and building time series forecasting models with RNNs and CNNs.
